# StressMaze Meltdown
In this game, you are a stressed out student who is working full time. You are pretty normal and boring. However, you have nightmares every night about being trapped in a labyrinth with no exit and a task: break all the walls to escape and wake up. Do so before you miss your alarm - if you don't wake up in time you will be late and this would probably lead to being fired.

Requirements for this project:
The task involves creating a joystick-controlled game. The LCD menu should include options for starting the game, viewing and updating highscores, adjusting settings (name entry, brightness controls, sound preferences), and accessing information about the game and its creator. During gameplay, display relevant information. Upon game completion, show a congratulatory message and display game info. The game must incorporate basic sounds,  and provide an intuitive and enjoyable experience. Address any issues with the timer not running out by checking the timer condition within the game loop. In my case, I do not have a highscore reset, a buzzer, and player names saved.

Components:
- 8X8 matrix
- max7219 Driver
- LCD display
- Joystick
- Potentiometer
